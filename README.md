# Ecommerce REST API

**For this project I built a E-commerce REST API using my knowledge of server-side development. This API allows the user to make the following requests:**
> - Allow users to register and log in via the API
> - Allow CRUD operations on products
> - Allow CRUD operations on user accounts
> - Allow CRUD operations on user carts
> - Allow a user to place an order
> - Allow CRUD operations on orders

## This Purpose of this project was to learn the following:
> - Node.js
> - Git and GitHub
> - Express.js
> - PostgreSQL
> - Command Line

#### More specifcally I used the following:
> - Version Controlling(Git/GitHub)
> - Routing Using Express.js
> - User Registration and Authorization(passport.js/auth-server)
> - Testing Endpoints(Postman)
> - API documentation(swagger.UI)
> - Database best practices and creation(PostgreSQL)
> - RESTful API guidelines.

Upcoming Projects:
- Reddit Client(React.js/Redux Application).
- Fullstack PERN Application.
